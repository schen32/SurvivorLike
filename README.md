## Description
Alien Survivors is a survivor-like game set on an alien planet.

The demo shows core features of the game, including levelling up, obtaining new weapons, and upgrading existing weapons.

The game is made in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia (SFML) library, with an custom engine that I built myself which adheres to Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
